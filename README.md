So we are going to implement an app for Online Book store. We will implement it step by step. In this app we will have the following domain models (entities):

### User:
Contains information about the registered user including their authentication details and personal information.
### Role:
Represents the role of a user in the system, for example, admin or user.
### Book:
Represents a book available in the store.
### Category:
Represents a category that a book can belong to.
### ShoppingCart:
Represents a user's shopping cart.
### CartItem:
Represents an item in a user's shopping cart.
### Order:
Represents an order placed by a user.
### OrderItem:
Represents an item in a user's order.

## Project description

I initiated the Book Store App project to enhance my understanding of the Spring Boot Framework and apply my skills in a practical context. This project replicates the structure of a genuine commercial venture, allowing me to delve into real-world application development.
### Structure Levels of the Project:
* model/dto
* dao/repository
* service
* controller
* security/validation
* config/mapper/exception classes

## People involved:

### Shopper (User):
Someone who looks at books, puts them in a basket (shopping cart), and buys them.
### Manager (Admin):
